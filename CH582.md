### Chip configuration

### Bootloader

To enter bootloader, you have to press the bottom button when plugging USB.

The bootloader will remain active for few seconds, waiting for upload.

Important: Because the badge reassigns the bootloader pin as GPIO after boot,
it is impossible to switch to bootloader as long as the battery is connected
to the board (the board is always powered and does not reset). To be able to
access the bootloader you must then desolder the battery.

## Development Hardware

* [WCH Link Debugger](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803507003815.html)

* [CH58x development board](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805118564658.html)

## Development software

* [WChisp firmware programmer](https://github.com/ch32-rs/wchisp)

* [CH583 Evaluation Board SDK](https://github.com/openwch/ch583)

* [Open Source Toolchain for CH582/CH583](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-ch32v)
  
  * Moonriver toolchain contains an older xpack and a custom openocd.

  * The more recent xpack toolchain changes using `riscv-none-elf-` as PREFIX in the Makefile instead of `riscv-none-embed-`. This target also requires to activate extensions seperately by setting `-march=rv32imac_zicsr` instead of `-march=rv32imac`
